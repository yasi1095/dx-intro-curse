# DX (Developer Experience) intro
**DX - Developer Experience. This tutorial introduces some of the features in the GitHub eco-system that will make your team go faster - in a very DevOpsy way.**

#### ðŸ‘‰ Create a copy of this repo ðŸ‘ˆ

Use this repo as a `template` - not a `fork`[^template]

[^template]: `template` and `fork` are two different concepts although somewhat similar; Forks clone all branches and all history, templates are complete detaced from the source [it's a fresh start](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#about-repository-templates). 

[`Code` >> `Use this template` >> `Create new repository`](/../../generate "Note that all links in GitHub issues, discussions and .md files opens default in the same tab as your current - so make it a habbit to hold down CTRL (Windows & Linux) or âŒ˜ (Mac) when you click a link")

#### ðŸ‘‰ Work those issues ðŸ‘ˆ

Continue there - in your own repo. Simply work the issues.

#### ðŸ‘‰ If you need help ðŸ‘ˆ
